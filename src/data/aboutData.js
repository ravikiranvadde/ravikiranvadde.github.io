    description1: "At Goldman Sachs, I work on the Subledger system and real-time data hydration platforms, building systems that ingest and process tens of millions of financial transactions daily. My work spans Java microservices, Kafka-based streaming, DB2 sharding, Snowflake lakehouse ingestion, and Kubernetes-based deployments, with a strong emphasis on fault tolerance, observability, and cost-efficient scaling. ",
    description2: "Previously, at Element Fleet Management and Verizon, I helped modernize legacy platforms into event-driven microservices, built high-volume order and billing systems, and delivered both backend APIs and frontend UIs using React and Angular. I care deeply about: Clean system design, Measurable impact (latency, throughput, cost savings), Production-ready engineering, Learning continuously and building things the right way.",
    description3: "Outside of work, I actively work on advanced system design and coding interviews, experiment with cloud-native architectures, and refine my engineering craft through hands-on problem solving.",
